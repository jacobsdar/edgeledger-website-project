## Introduction

*Brad Traversy's Edge Ledger website project. In this project I showcase some basic CSS and HTML to create and style a static website. In this project I will make use of media queries and flexbox in order to make it fully responsive on mobile as well as tablet. I will visually copy and recreate the existing project from Brad Traversy's course, but will use my own initiative and knowledge to complete the project.*

## Technologies

* HTML5
* CSS3 includes:
  - Basic CSS3
  - Flexbox will be used for the layout, as well as used to make the site responsive
  - Media queries will also be used for responsiveness
  - JavaScript for the maps API and smooth scrolling

## Launch

*Website will be launched as soon as I gain the necessary skills*
